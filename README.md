## Customization

### Adding New Routes
Edit the `get_available_routes()` function in `app.py` to add new airline routes.

### Modifying Analysis Logic
Update the `DataProcessor` class in `data_processor.py` to customize analysis algorithms.

### Enhancing AI Insights
Modify the `AIAnalyzer` class in `ai_analyzer.py` to improve AI-powered analysis.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)`

3. **AI Analysis Not Working**
   - Check if OpenAI API key is set in `.env` file
   - The app will use fallback analysis if no API key is provided

4. **Charts Not Displaying**
   - Ensure internet connection for Plotly CDN
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
